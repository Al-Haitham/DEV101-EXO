# Exercises & Small Programs

A collection of small programs and exercises — class assignments and free-time projects — created to practice coding and learn new concepts.

## Repository structure

- Each project or exercise lives in its own folder.
- Folders are named clearly (e.g. `sorting-algorithms/`, `calculator-python/`).
- Check each project folder for a local `README.md` with run/setup instructions.

This repo may contain multiple languages depending on the exercise. Examples you might see:
- Python
- JavaScript / Node.js
- C / C++
- Java
(Currently learning: Python)

- Experiment with different programming concepts

---
## Notes

- Projects are for learning and demonstration — not production-ready.
- Check each project folder for dependencies and specific run instructions.
